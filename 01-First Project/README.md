Session 1: Introduction and Vibe Check

Assignment
In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from this repository) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found here!

How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.
Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!
