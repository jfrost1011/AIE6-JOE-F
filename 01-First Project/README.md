Session 1: Introduction and Vibe Check

Assignment
In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from this repository) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!


How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.
Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!
üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:
Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
Aspect Tested:
High-level explanation of object-oriented programming (clarity, simplicity, and use of examples).
Result of Test:
‚ùå Not passing the vibe check because, although the explanation was clear and used a relatable metaphor (a car), it was overly detailed and lengthy. For a complete beginner, shorter and simpler explanations tend to be more effective, as too many steps or details can become overwhelming.
Suggestion for Improvement:
Consider condensing the explanation to just one or two sentences clearly defining objects, attributes, and methods, followed by one straightforward example to maintain simplicity and ensure the beginner remains engaged.

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points...
Aspect Tested:
Concise summarization of key points (clarity, brevity, accuracy).
Result of Test:
‚ùå Not passing the vibe check because the chatbot's output, although accurate and clear, was not sufficiently concise. The summary closely mirrors the original paragraph length and structure, which defeats the purpose of providing a brief overview. A good summary should significantly condense the information into fewer sentences while still capturing the essential points clearly.
Suggestion for Improvement:
Consider reducing the summary to a shorter format (2-3 sentences at most). Each industry‚Äôs impact could be mentioned briefly, without the detailed explanations provided in the original paragraph, ensuring a quick, clear overview that remains accurate and accessible.

3.Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
Aspect Tested:
Creative storytelling, imagination, emotional engagement, adherence to word limit.
Result of Test:
‚úÖ Passing the vibe check because the story is imaginative, heartwarming, and clearly illustrates friendship emerging from an unexpected situation. The characters (Spark and Buzz) are relatable, and the narrative effectively conveys a simple, emotional message suitable for its audience.
Minor Suggestion for Improvement:
Consider enhancing the story's emotional depth slightly by briefly showing Spark‚Äôs initial loneliness or isolation before meeting Buzz, to make their newfound friendship even more meaningful.
Overall Impression:
The chatbot performed well by creating an engaging, concise, and imaginative story suitable for a wide audience.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
Aspect Tested:
Accuracy, clarity, simplicity, step-by-step logical reasoning.
Result of Test:
‚úÖ Passing the vibe check because the chatbot correctly solved the problem, clearly explaining each step, and provided a simple, logical breakdown. The answer was precise, accurate, and easy to follow.
Suggestion for Improvement:
Although clear, the response could be even more concise. Reducing repetitive phrasing like "exactly" or summarizing the final answer in a shorter sentence might improve readability.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
Aspect Tested:
Formal tone, professionalism, clarity, conciseness.
Result of Test:
‚úÖ Passing the vibe check because the rewritten paragraph successfully converted the casual message into a professional, clear, and formally worded announcement. It effectively uses polite language ("Dear team members") and precise terms ("rescheduled," "facilitate a comprehensive review") suitable for professional communication.
Minor Suggestion for Improvement:
The phrase "to 3 pm instead of 2 pm" could be slightly refined for formality. For example: "has been rescheduled from 2 pm to 3 pm."

üöß Advanced Build:
Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.


üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:
What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

Answer:
Vibe checking can offer an intuitive initial impression, but there are several key drawbacks worth highlighting:

Lack of Consistency: Since vibe checks rely heavily on individual perceptions, the results can vary dramatically from person to person. This inconsistency makes it difficult to establish uniform criteria for comparison across different models or scenarios.

Non-Measurable Results: Unlike structured evaluation metrics, vibe checks don't provide measurable outcomes. Without numerical scores or defined parameters, it becomes challenging to track progress over time or objectively determine improvements between different versions.

Inefficient for Large-Scale Deployment: Vibe checking is inherently manual and demands significant human effort, making it unsuitable for evaluating numerous models or systems regularly. When applied at scale, it quickly becomes impractical, costly, and time-consuming.

Nevertheless, vibe checking can serve effectively as an exploratory tool early in the model development process, offering preliminary qualitative insights before moving on to more structured and quantifiable evaluation techniques.
