Assignment
In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from this repository) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found here!

How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.
Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!
🏗️ Activity #1:
Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
Aspect Tested:
Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
Aspect Tested:
Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
Aspect Tested:
If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
Aspect Tested:
Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
Aspect Tested:
This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

🚧 Advanced Build:
Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

A Note on Vibe Checking
"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:
What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
