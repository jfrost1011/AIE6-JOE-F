# AI Engineering Bootcamp (AIE6)

This repository contains my projects and coursework for the AI Engineering Bootcamp. The curriculum is designed to provide comprehensive training in building, evaluating, and deploying production-grade LLM applications.

## üéØ Learning Journey

Throughout this bootcamp, I'm developing skills across 10 key dimensions:

### üèóÔ∏è Prototyping LLM Applications
1. **Understanding LLMs**: Mastering prompt engineering, LLM architectures, capabilities, and limitations
2. **Building RAG Applications**: Creating retrieval-augmented generation systems that enhance LLM outputs with external knowledge
3. **Building Agent & Multi-Agent Applications**: Developing autonomous AI agents and multi-agent systems using LangGraph
4. **Fine-Tuning LLMs & Embedding Models**: Customizing models for specific domains and use cases
5. **Deploying LLM Prototype Applications**: Making applications accessible to users through deployment platforms

### üö¢ Production-Grade Applications
6. **Evaluating RAG and Agent Applications**: Using metrics-driven development with tools like RAGAS to improve systems
7. **Improving Search and Retrieval Pipelines**: Optimizing retrieval methods for production environments
8. **Monitoring Production KPIs**: Tracking performance indicators in production LLM applications
9. **Setting up Inference Servers**: Configuring servers for open-source LLMs and embedding models
10. **Building with Scalable Components**: Creating applications with production-grade architecture that can scale

## üìö Course Structure

The bootcamp is organized into three major sections over 10 weeks:

### üèóÔ∏è Prototyping (Build)

- **Week 3**: Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
- **Week 4**: RAG & Agent Evaluation with Synthetic Data
- **Week 5**: Fine-Tuning LLMs and Embedding Models
- **Week 6**: Certification Challenge and Project Pitches

### üö¢ Production (Ship)
- **Week 7**: Advanced Retrieval and Agentic Reasoning
- **Week 8**: Practical RAG - Production Endpoints and LLM Ops
- **Week 9**: On-Prem Agents & Inference Optimization

### üöÄ Demo Day (Share)
- **Week 10**: Final Project Demonstration

## üìÅ Projects Directory

The repository is organized by weekly projects:

- **01-First Project**: Initial RAG application
- **Weekly projects will be added as the bootcamp progresses**

## üåü Final Certification Challenge

The bootcamp culminates in a certification challenge where I'll:
1. Define a problem and audience
2. Propose a solution
3. Deal with data
4. Build an end-to-end prototype
5. Create a golden test data set
6. Fine-tune embeddings
7. Assess performance

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through the bootcamp!
